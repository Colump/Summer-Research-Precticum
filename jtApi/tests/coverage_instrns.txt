1. Do 'coverage run' first to run the unit tests
   and collect the data for determining the code coverage.
2. Use ‘coverage report’ (or 'coverage html') command next to show
   a basic text output of the code coverage.

coverage run --include=jt_utils.py tests/test_jt_utils.py
coverage report jt_utils.py
coverage html jt_utils.py

# Having trouble with wildcards... hmmm....
coverage run --include=[jt_utils.py,jt_flask_module.py,jt_gtfs_loader.py] tests/test*.py
coverage report jt_*.py
coverage html jt_*.py
